/**
 * Cheryl's Birthday problem.
 * 
 * Albert and Bernard have just met Cheryl. 
 * "When is your birthday?" Albert asked Cheryl. 
 * Cheryl thought for a moment and said, "I won't tell you, but I'll give you some clues". 
 * She wrote down a list of ten dates:
 *  <li> May 15, May 16, May 19
 *  <li> June 17, June 18
 *  <li> July 14, July 16
 *  <li> August 14, August 15, August 17
 *  
 *  "One of these is my birthday" she said.
 *  Cheryl whispered in Albert's ear the month, and only the month, of her birthday. 
 *  To Bernard, she whispered the day, and only the day. 
 *  "Can you figure it out now?" she asked Albert.
 *  
 *  Albert: "I don't know when your birthday is, but I know Bernard doesn't know, either."
 *  
 *  Bernard: "I didn't know originally, but now I do."
 *  
 *  Albert: "Well, now I know, too!"
 *  
 *  When is Cheryl's birthday?
